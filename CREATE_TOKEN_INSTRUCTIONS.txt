GITHUB TOKEN CREATION - QUICK GUIDE
====================================

I've opened the GitHub token creation page in your browser.

REQUIRED SETTINGS:
------------------
1. Note/Name: QuantLet Submission
2. Expiration: 30 days (or your preference)
3. Scopes to select:
   [X] repo (Full control of private repositories)
   [X] workflow (optional, but recommended)

4. Click "Generate token" at the bottom

5. IMPORTANT: Copy the token immediately!
   It starts with: ghp_
   You won't be able to see it again!

6. Come back here and I'll use it to submit.

WAITING FOR YOUR TOKEN...
========================

Once you have the token, we'll run:
python quantlet_auto_submit.py --token YOUR_TOKEN_HERE

This will automatically:
- Create the GitHub repository
- Push all your code
- Submit to QuantLet organization
